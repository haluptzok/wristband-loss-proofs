# Wristband Loss — Lean 4 Proofs

Machine-checked proofs for the mathematical foundations of the
[Wristband Gaussian Loss](https://github.com/mvparakhin/ml-tidbits)
(`C_WristbandGaussianLoss` in `EmbedModels.py`).

## The Central Theorem

For any distribution $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^d \setminus \{0\}$ with $d \ge 2$:

$$\Phi_{\#} Q \;=\; \sigma_{d-1} \otimes \mathrm{Unif}[0,1] \quad\iff\quad Q = \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$$

where $\Phi(z) = \bigl(z/\|z\|,\; F_{\chi^2_d}(\|z\|^2)\bigr)$ is the wristband map.

**In plain terms:** the wristband map produces uniform output *if and only if*
the input is standard Gaussian. No distribution can fake Gaussianity through
the wristband lens.

## Proof Status

| Step | What it proves | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 1. Wristband equivalence | Uniform wristband output $\iff$ Gaussian input | **Complete** (sorry-free) |
| 2. Kernel energy minimization | Repulsion kernel uniquely minimized at uniform | **Complete** for Neumann kernel |
| 3. Main correctness | Repulsion loss uniquely identifies the Gaussian | Planned (combines Steps 1+2) |
| 4. Auxiliary terms | Radial, moment, angular penalties preserve the minimizer | Planned |

correspondence, axiom inventory, and remaining work.
